# KilnTimer
Knuckles Glass Kiln Timer using a micro controller and tilt switch to reset an LCD clock


I made this timer to sit on the back of my 99LS kiln. When the door is opened, it will trip the 6 axis sensor and reset the timer on the lcd. I have had some issues with setting up the code to work efficently and accurately.
The clock is off a bit and the LCD pulls a ton of juice with the backlight. I added a sensitivity POT to the back of the unit to adjust for different kiln set-ups.
